% EXTERNAL RESOURCES:
%   Resources should be stored in the "resources" folder, TeX or not,
%   including but not limited to:
%       - Images                    <- resources/images/...
%       - Figures                   <- resources/figures/...
%       - Tables                    <- resources/tables/...
%       - Listings (code snippets)  <- resources/code/...
%       - Bibliographies            <- resources/bibliography.bib
%       - Glossaries                <- resources/{acronyms.text}
%                                                 {glossary.tex}
%
%   Images **specifically** are stored relative to "resources/images"
%
%   Resource loading and imports are handled in the "include" folder,
%   you should define any imports in the "include/def_imports.tex" file.
%
% PART PREAMBLES:
%   When creating a part of more than 1 sub-part, e.g. not "title", it
%   is **highly** recommended you include a preamble TeX file of the
%   same name to handle any pre-processing, rather than in the first

%   subpart - this maintains the ethos of a modular library, and will
%   keep your project manageable!
%
% CREATING PARTS:
%   Use \include{} to include a new (set of) page(s) starting with a new
%   page right from the get-go automatically.
%
% CREATING SUB-PARTS:
%   Within pages, use \input{} to include sections etc., these do not
%   automatically add page-breaks, so any page-breaks still need to be
%   specified manually.
%
%   NOTE:
%       \input{} takes **absolute** paths, from the Overleaf root dir
%       onward to load from, "parts/title" is "parts/title" everywhere.
