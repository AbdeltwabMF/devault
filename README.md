### What is Devault?
Decentralized storage is one of the hottest blockchain use-cases.

## Why Decentralized Vault?
- It is a decentralized storage system that is based on blockchain.
- It encrypts data and stores it in a decentralized cloud.
- It breaks apart the usersâ€™ files and distributes them across multiple nodes on their network.
- The encryption & decryption is done on the client-side witch is make a lot of sense for the user.
- Only users who have a wallet can access the data.
- Only users who have the key can access the data.
- The smart contract is upgradable, so the data is never lost when there is a bug fix.
- It prevents the data from being tampered with.
- It prevents the censorship of the data.
- It is open source.

## How Decentralized Vault Works?
- First: create a wallet.
	- The wallet is a private key that is used to sign transactions.
	- we use [metamask](https://metamask.io/) as a web3 provider. So you can use metamask to create a wallet and start using decentralized vault.
- Second: connect the wallet to the application.
  - through the connect wallet button.
- Third: upload files.
	- You will be asked for a password to encrypt the file with.
	- Then your file is split into smaller chunks, cryptographically hashed, and given a unique fingerprint called a content identifier (CID).
	- The chunks distributed to multiple nodes on the network.
- Fourth: download files.
	- The file will be reconstructed from the chunks.
	- You will be asked for a password to decrypt the file with.
	- The file gets decrypted and downloaded.


## :biking_man: Getting Started

### :yellow_circle: Prerequisites

This project uses `npm` as a package manager

```sh
pacman -S npm
```

### :wrench: Run for development

- Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AbdeltwabMF/devault.git
cd devault
```

- Install dependencies

```sh
npm ci
```

- Run the development server and local blockchain node.

```sh
npm run deploy localhost
```

- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` <br/>

:green_circle: _Now you're good to go_

#### :syringe: Run the tests

- Run the smart contracts test

```sh
npx hardhat test
```

- Generates a code coverage report for smart contracts test

```sh
npx hardhat coverage
```

- Run the whole project tests

```sh
npm run test
```

### :sparkles: Deployment | Hosting

- Deploy using source code and docker

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AbdeltwabMF/devault.git
cd devault
```

```sh
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate -d
```

- Deploy using official docker image hosted on docker hub

```sh
docker container run -p 3000:3000 -d abdeltwabmf/devault
```

- Deploy using vercel

```sh
npm i -g vercel
```

```sh
vercel --prod
```

- Deploy using static site generation

The generated static site will be in the `out` directory (ex. use `nginx` to serve it)

```sh
npm run build2
```
